Browser Test using Webdriverio + Appium + chromedriver

When it comes to testing mobile browsers, there are different tools available, and each one has its strengths and weaknesses. In a monorepo comparing Cypress and WebdriverIO+Appium+Chromedriver, we found that simulating a mobile device screen using either Cypress or WebdriverIO on the browser is much easier than setting up and running tests on a real or emulated mobile device using WebdriverIO and Appium.

Cypress is a popular testing framework that provides an easy-to-use API for testing web applications. With its unique architecture, Cypress can run tests on the browser and mock responses, making it easy to test and debug mobile views.

On the other hand, WebdriverIO is a popular automation framework that provides support for a wide range of web and mobile testing scenarios. WebdriverIO can work with Appium to automate tests on real and emulated mobile devices, making it a great choice when it comes to testing mobile browsers.

While both Cypress and WebdriverIO have their strengths, we found that using either of them to simulate mobile screens on the browser is a much more straightforward process compared to running tests on real or emulated mobile devices. However, if it is of utmost importance to run tests on real or emulated mobile devices, then WebdriverIO with Appium and Chromedriver is a good choice, as it provides a simpler setup and configuration compared to using Appium and Chromedriver in other languages, while also allowing developers to work in JavaScript, a language that is easy to learn.
